Goal: Build a simple CPU in verilog in under 12 hours.

It should be capable of running CORDIC, an eight tap FIR filter, and calculating SQRT in a reasonable amount of time.

It should support branch, jump, ALU, and load/store word instructions, being functionally turing complete.

It'll be RISC, Harvard arch, modeled off the attiny.
