Multiplication of I16Q16 = I32Q32

For mul

Truncate 

so what happens if overflow?

Addition: Flag hard! No real choice if addition becomes too big.

Multiplication: Flag! Need to calculate if it is problem

----

Actually, the chip has an overflow sensor, so presumably, the chip will flag overflow.

there's a good chance I'll be doing on



Design choice: I16Q16 representing each entry in the matrix.
Justification: Enabling fixed point addition/multiplication is a precursor to implementing floating point addition/multiplication. As a proof of concept, I16Q16 is good enough to demonstrate the validity of our algorithms.

Design choice: The ALU chip will throw overflow flags on addition and multiplication overflow.
Justification: Rotating the matrix and calculating arc tans can cause overflow, which would be disastrous if not identified. The ALU uses logic to write all 1s as a failure case if overflow results (floating point: Not a Number). This allows for easy overflow checking.

4 registers for A
4 registers for U
4 registers for V
2-4 registers for E
4-6 registers for temp

= 22 registers wanted

$2-$27 are the values we want to use

1+0 = 0 or 1
0+1 = 0 or 1
0+0 = 0
1+1 = 11

we can translate to any negative numbers by adding 1s to the ends of all negative numbers.

.000001 * =.00001 = 0

1*1 = 1 which works with multiplication
-1*-1 = 1 works
